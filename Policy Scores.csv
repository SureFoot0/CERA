Its latest NDC, however, provides more detail on additional information that improves transparency around the UK's decarbonization plans.
The UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK must meet legally binding carbon ""budgets"", committing the UK to cuts its emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.
