THE SCORING SYSTEM FOR POLICIES

SCORE 1 - Scope: The Extent of Sectors Covered
Definition: Scope refers to the breadth of sectors (e.g., energy, transportation, agriculture, industry) that the policy addresses. A broad scope indicates a comprehensive approach to tackling environmental challenges.

CRITERIA
1: Policy covers only one sector with narrow focus and limited impact.
2: Policy covers a few related sectors but lacks integration across broader areas.
3: Policy covers several key sectors but omits some important areas.
4: Policy covers most relevant sectors, showing strong cross-sectoral integration.
5: Policy is comprehensive, covering major sectors with well-defined interconnections.

KEY INDICATORS:
Number of sectors covered.
Integration of cross-sectoral impacts.
Inclusiveness of key industries and economic activities.
Consideration of both direct and indirect emissions within each sector.


SCORE 2 - Ambition: Emission Reduction Targets
Definition: Ambition assesses the stringency and rigor of the policy's emission reduction targets, reflecting the policy's alignment with international climate goals like the Paris Agreement.

CRITERIA
1: Targets are vague, non-committal, and lack timelines.
2: Targets are set, but they are weak or significantly below international standards.
3: Targets are moderate, aligned with national objectives but not fully aligned with global best practices.
4: Targets are strong, ambitious, and in line with or slightly exceed international commitments.

Alignment with global climate commitments (e.g., Paris Agreement).
Inclusion of both short-term and long-term goals.
Flexibility to increase ambition over time.


SCORE 3 - Implementation: Enforcement of Mechanisms and Compliance
Definition: Implementation evaluates the mechanisms in place to enforce the policy, ensure compliance, and measure progress. Effective implementation is critical to translating policy into action.

CRITERIA
1: Implementation mechanisms are non-existent or purely voluntary with no enforcement.

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
For each dataset:
    Clean missing values
    Normalize data if necessary

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
Create interaction terms, e.g., GDP_t * REN_t
Create lagged variables, e.g., INVT_t-1, INVT_t-2
Create non-linear terms, e.g., (GDP_t)^2
Create additional interaction terms, e.g., TECH_t * INVT_t
Create additional lagged variables, e.g., TECH_t-1, AWARE_t-1

# Step 4: Model Initialization
Define the model: 
Y_t = β_0 + β_1 * GDP_t + β_2 * POP_t + β_3 * EI_t + β_4 * CI_t +
      β_5 * REN_t + β_6 * INVT_t + β_7 * POL_t + β_8 * TEMP_t + 
      β_9 * IND_t + β_10 * TRANS_t + β_11 * URB_t + β_12 * AGRI_t + 
      β_13 * TECH_t + β_14 * ECO_t + β_15 * ENF_t + β_16 * AWARE_t +
      interaction terms + lagged terms + non-linear terms + ε_t

# Step 5: Model Training (OLS Regression)
Estimate β_0, β_1, ..., β_16 using OLS regression
Fit the model to the data using a statistical software package or programming language like R, python (using stats model or sci-kit learn), or any other suitable libraries 

# Step 6: Diagnostics
Check for multicollinearity using VIF
	If VIF>10, consider variables to be highly collinear
	Remove or combine correlated variables if necessary
Test for autocorrelation using the Durbin-Watson statistic
	If Durbin-Watson is significantly higher than 2, consider adding logged dependent variables
Check for heteroscedasticity using the Breusch-Pagan or White test
	If heteroscedasticity is detected, use heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors
Test for normality of residuals using the Shapiro-Wilk test
	If residuals are not normally distributed, consider transforming the dependent variable (e.g., log transformation)
	
//* Detailed explanation: 
Checking for multicollinearity (mc) using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)
MC usually occurs when the independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, leading to unreliable estimates of regression coefficients 
How to check?
First, calculate the VIF for each independent variable
A VIF value greater than 10 is commonly used as a threshold to indicate high multicollinearity 
Actions to take:
If VIF>10, then variables are highly collinear 
Remove or combine highly correlated variables
Drop one of the correlated variables
Combine variables into a single predictor (through PCA - principal component analysis) 
Test for autocorrelation using the D-W statistic 
Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals or errors of a regression model are correlated across observations, and that violates the assumption of independence 
Method: 
Calculate D-W statistics: Values from 0 to 4
DW ~ 2 suggests no autocorrelation.
DW < 2 positive autocorrelation
DW > 2 negative autocorrelation 
Heteroscedasticity using the B-P 
It usually occurs when the variance of the residuals is not constant across all levels of the independent variables 
How to check
Perform B-P 
A significant p-value (<0.05) indicates the presence of heteroscedasticity 
If detected, use heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors to correct this issue


Normality of Residuals using the Shapiro-Wilk Test
The Normality of residuals assumes that the residuals of the regression model should follow a normal distribution.
How to Check:
Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test on the residuals of the regression model.
A significant p-value (typically < 0.05) indicates that the residuals are not normally distributed.
Action:
If the residuals are not normally distributed, consider transforming the dependent variable. Common transformations include log transformation, square root transformation, or Box-Cox transformation.

# Step 7: Model Refinement
If multicollinearity is detected:
    Remove or combine correlated variables
If autocorrelation is detected:
    Add lagged dependent variable(s)
If heteroscedasticity is detected:
    Use heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors
If residuals are not normal:
    Transform dependent variable (e.g., log transformation)

# Step 8: Model Validation
Split data into training and holdout sets
	Use 70-30 split or k-fold cross-validation
Train model on the training set
Validate model on holdout set
	Compare predicted values with actual values to assess model performance 
	Calculate performance metrics: R-squared, MAE, RMSE, etc.
Or use time-series cross-validation
	Train model on different periods and validate on subsequent periods
	Evaluate model stability and predictive accuracy over time

# Step 9: Scenario and Sensitivity Analysis
For each policy scenario:
    Adjust policy variables (POL_t, ENF_t)
    Predict Y_t using the model
	Assess impact of policy changes on Y_t
For sensitivity analysis:
    Vary one independent variable at a time (e.g., increase/decrease GDP_t by 10%)
    Observe the impact on Y_t
	Document the sensitivity of Y_t to changes in each independent variable 
	Visualize sensitivity analysis results using graphs (py dash)

# Step 10: Output and Reporting
Report model coefficients and their significance
	Interpret the coefficients in the context of the study  
Discuss diagnostic test results
	Explain any corrective measures taken based on diagnostics 
	Provide insights into model assumptions and their validity 
Present scenario and sensitivity analysis results
	Use tables, graphs, and charts to illustrate findings 
	Discuss the implications of different policy standards 
Communicate model limitations and uncertainty
	Acknowledge potential sources of error and uncertainty in the model
	Discuss external factors that may influence the model’s predictions
	Recommend areas for further research and model improvement
